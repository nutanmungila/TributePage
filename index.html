            <h3>Here's a time line of Dr. Borlaug's life:</h3>
            <p> <strong>1914</strong> - Born in Cresco, Iowa</p>
            <p> <strong>1933</strong> - Leaves his family's farm to attend the University of Minnesota,
               thanks to a Depression era program known as the "National Youth Administration"</p>
            <p> <strong>1935</strong> - Has to stop school and save up more money. Works in the Civilian
              Conservation Corps, helping starving Americans. "I saw how food changed them", he said. "All
              of this left scars on me."</p>
            <p><strong>1970</strong> - receives the Nobel Peace Prize.</p>
            <p><strong>1983</strong> - helps seven African countries dramatically increase their maize and
              sorghum yields.</p>
            <p><strong>1984</strong> - becomes a distinguished professor at Texas A&M University.</p>
            <p><strong>2005</strong> - states "we will have to double the world food supply by 2050."
              Argues that genetically modified crops are the only way we can meet the demand, as we run
              out of arable land. Says that GM crops are not inherently dangerous because "we've been genetically
              modifying plants and animals for a long time. Long before we called it science, people were selecting
              the best breeds."</p>
